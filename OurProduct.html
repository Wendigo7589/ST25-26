        <h3>
            inspired by an energy harvesting sidewalk made by Pavegen, it is a seat that collects kinetic energy from someone sitting and standing up, powering a generator in the seat and powers the stadium

        <h1>The Science behind our project</h1>
        <h3>Powering a modern stadium takes a huge amount of energy, usually around 10–20 megawatts (MW) during a big event. That’s way more than people can make just by moving, but the cool part is that human energy can help reduce the load. When people jump, stand, or sit, they create small bursts of force that can be captured using special floor tiles called piezoelectric tiles. One person stepping on a tile can make around 5 watts, which is tiny, but when thousands of people do it together—especially during something like “the wave,” which makes fans stand, sit, and stomp in a repeating rhythm—you can collect a surprising amount of energy. For example, if 50,000 fans each produce 5 watts, you get around 250,000 watts (250 kW), which is about 2.5% of a 10-MW stadium’s needs. Then, if the stadium also has a huge solar-panel roof, that can give a lot more power. A typical stadium-sized solar roof can make around 5–10 MW, so if you originally had only 1/3 of the power needed, adding solar and human-generated energy could raise your total to roughly 50–60% of what the stadium needs during an event. You can estimate this using a simple formula: Total Energy = (People × Energy per Person) + Solar Energy + Starting Energy. With this formula, you can plug in any number of fans, any size of solar roof, and any starting amount of electricity to figure out how close you can get to fully powering the stadium.</h3>

        <h1>Profits</h1>
        <h3>Our company, Farmers of Electricity, is built to grow quickly and make strong profits as we begin selling our pressure-based power-generating systems. Because the product is inexpensive to produce but easy to sell to stadium owners, our profit potential rises every year. In the first year, with an expected 50,000 units sold, we project earning around $700,000 in profit, which shows that there is already strong interest in cleaner and cheaper stadium energy. By year three, sales are expected to increase to 125,000 units, raising our profits to about $1.7 million. By year five, as more stadiums, schools, and venues adopt our technology, we expect to sell 500,000 units, reaching almost $5 million in profit. These increasing numbers show that our business becomes more successful the longer it operates. Even though our startup costs are small—about $500–$550 to build the first 25 prototypes—we expect the company to grow quickly once investors help fund the final development stage. With a $10,000 investment, we can finish creating a mass-produced version of our product and begin earning steady profits from customers who want cleaner and more affordable energy solutions for their stadiums.</h3>

        <h1>Marketing</h1>
        <h3>To effectively market our product, we will focus on strategies that directly reach stadium owners and decision-makers in the sports industry. Our main method will be personal marketing, where we create a professional website that demonstrates how our pressure-powered technology works, how much money stadiums can save, and how it reduces fossil-fuel use. The website will include visuals, product demos, and clear data showing the benefits of our system. We will also use digital marketing by creating short online advertisements that highlight our product’s unique features—its small size, low cost, and ability to generate clean energy from fans simply sitting and standing. These ads can be shared on social media platforms where stadium owners, sports organizations, and venue managers are active, helping us build awareness and attract potential buyers.</h3>
